The Norm
Version 3

This document describes the applicable standard (Norm) at 42.
A programming standard defines a set of rules to follow when writing code.
The Norm applies to all C projects within the Common Core by default, 
and to any project where it’s specified.

The norminette is in python and open source.
Its repository is available at https://github.com/42School/norminette.


Why ?

• Sequencing:

coding implies splitting a big and complex task into a long series of elementary instructions. 
All these instructions will be executed in sequence: one after another. 

A beginner that starts creating software needs a simple and clear architecture for their project, 
with a full understanding of all individual instructions and the precise order of execution. 

Cryptic language syntaxes that do multiple instructions apparently at the same time are confusing.

Functions that try to address multiple tasks mixed in the same portion of code are source of errors.

The Norm asks you to create simple pieces of code, 
where the unique task of each piece can be clearly understood and verified, 
and where the sequence of all the executed instructions leaves no doubt. 

That’s why we ask for 25 lines maximum in functions, 
also why for, do .. while, or ternaries are forbidden.

• Look and Feel:

while exchanging with your friends and workmates during the normal peer-learning process, 
and also during the peer-evaluations, you do not want to spend time to decrypt their code, 
but directly talk about the logic of the piece of code.

The Norm asks you to use a specific look and feel, 
providing instructions for the naming of the functions and variables, 
indentation, brace rules, tab and spaces at many places... .

This will allow you to smoothly have a look at other’s codes that will look familiar, 
and get directly to the point instead of spending time to read the code before understanding it. 
The Norm also comes as a trademark. 
As part of the 42 community, you will be able to recognize code written 
by another 42 student or alumni when you’ll be in the labor market.

• Long-term vision: 

making the effort to write understandable code is the best way to maintain it. 
Each time that someone else, including you, has to fix a bug or add a new feature 
they won’t have to lose their precious time trying to figure out what it does 
if previously you did things in the right way. 
This will avoid situations where pieces of code stop being maintained 
just because it is time-consuming, and that can make the difference 
when we talk about having a successful product in the market.

the functions should be short and just do one thing,
the name of the variables should make sense,
lines shouldn’t be longer than 80 columns wide,
a function should not take many parameters,
comments should be useful, 
etc, etc, etc...


Denomination

• A structure’s name must start by s_.
• A typedef’s name must start by t_.
• A union’s name must start by u_.
• An enum’s name must start by e_.
• A global’s name must start by g_.

• Variables and functions names can only contain lowercases, digits and ’_’

• Files and directories names can only contain lowercases, digits and ’_’ 

• Characters that aren’t part of the standard ASCII table are forbidden.

• Variables, functions, and any other identifier must use snake case. 
No capital letters, and each word separated by an underscore.

• All identifiers (functions, macros, types, variables, etc.) must be in English.

• Objects (variables, functions, macros, types, files or directories) 
must have the most explicit or most mnemonic names as possible.

• Using global variables that are not marked const and static is forbidden 
and is considered a norm error, unless the project explicitly allows them.

• The file must compile. A file that doesn’t compile isn’t expected to pass the Norm.


Formatting

• You must indent your code with 4-space tabulations. 
This is not the same as 4 average spaces, we’re talking about real tabulations here.

• Each function must be maximum 25 lines, 
not counting the function’s own curly brackets.
(42 ft count line / vscode extension by DoKca)

• Each line must be at most 80 columns wide, comments included. 
Warning: a tabulation doesn’t count as a column, but as the number of spaces it represents.


• Each function must be separated by a newline. 
Any comment or preprocessor instruction can be right above the function. 
The newline is after the previous function.

• One instruction per line.

• An empty line must be empty: no spaces or tabulations.

• A line can never end with spaces or tabulations.

• You can never have two consecutive spaces.

• You need to start a new line after each curly bracket or end of control structure.

• Unless it’s the end of a line, each comma or semi-colon must be followed by a space.

• Each operator or operand must be separated by one - and only one - space.

• Each C keyword must be followed by a space, except for keywords for types 
(such as int, char, float, etc.), as well as sizeof.

• Each variable declaration must be indented on the same column for its scope.

• The asterisks that go with pointers must be stuck to variable names.

• One single variable declaration per line.

• Declaration and an initialisation cannot be on the same line, 
except for global variables (when allowed), static variables, and constants.

• Declarations must be at the beginning of a function.

• In a function, you must place an empty line between 
variable declarations and the remaining of the function. 
No other empty lines are allowed in a function.

• Multiple assignments are strictly forbidden.

• You may add a new line after an instruction or control structure, 
but you’ll have to add an indentation with brackets or assignment operator. 
Operators must be at the beginning of a line.



• Control structures (if, while..) must have braces, unless they contain a single line.

• Braces following functions, declarators or control structures 
must be preceded andfollowed by a newline.


Functions

• A function can take 4 named parameters maximum.

• A function that doesn’t take arguments must be explicitly prototyped 
with the word "void" as the argument.

• Parameters in functions’ prototypes must be named.

• Each function must be separated from the next by an empty line.

• You can’t declare more than 5 variables per function.

• Return of a function has to be between parenthesis.

• Each function must have a single tabulation between its return type and its name.


Typedef, struct, enum and union

• Add a tabulation when declaring a struct, enum or union.

• When declaring a variable of type struct, enum or union, 
add a single space in the type.

• When declaring a struct, union or enum with a typedef, 
all indentation rules apply.

• Typedef name must be preceded by a tab.

• You must indent all structures’ names on the same column for their scope.

• You cannot declare a structure in a .c file.


Headers - a.k.a include files

• The things allowed in header files are: header inclusions (system or not), 
declarations, defines, prototypes and macros.

• All includes must be at the beginning of the file.

• You cannot include a C file.

• Header files must be protected from double inclusions. 
(handled by the '#ifndef' in .h files)

• Unused header inclusions (.h) are forbidden.

• All header inclusions must be justified in a .c file as well as in a .h file.


The 42 header - a.k.a start a file with style

• Every .c and .h file must immediately begin with the standard 42 header 
: a multiline comment with a special format including useful informations. 

The standard header is naturally available on computers in clusters for various text editors 
(emacs: using C-c C-h, vim using :Stdheader or F1, etc...).

• The 42 header must contain several informations up-to-date, 
including the creator with login and email, 
the date of creation, the login and date of the last update.
Each time the file is saved on disk, the information should be automatically updated.


Macros and Pre-processors

• Preprocessor constants (or #define) you create 
must be used only for literal and constant values.

• All #define created to bypass the norm and/or obfuscate code are forbidden. 
This part must be checked by a human.

• You can use macros available in standard libraries, 
only if those ones are allowed in the scope of the given project.

• Multiline macros are forbidden.

• Macro names must be all uppercase.

• You must indent characters following #if, #ifdef or #ifndef.


Forbidden stuff!

• You’re not allowed to use:

◦ for
◦ do...while
◦ switch
◦ case
◦ goto
• Ternary operators such as ‘?’.
• VLAs - Variable Length Arrays.
• Implicit type in variable declarations


Comments

• Comments cannot be inside functions’ bodies. 
Comments must be at the end of a line, or on their own line

• Your comments must be in English. And they must be useful.

• A comment cannot justify the creation of a carryall or bad function.
A carryall or bad function usually comes with names 
that are not explicit such as 
f1, f2... for the function and 
a, b, i,.. for the declarations. 

A function whose only goal is to avoid the norm, 
without a unique logical purpose, 
is also considered as a bad function. 

Please remember that it is desirable to have clear and readable functions 
that each achieve a clear and simple task. 

Avoid any code obfuscation techniques, such as the one-liner..


Files

• You cannot include a .c file.

• You cannot have more than 5 function-definitions in a .c file.


Makefile

Makefiles aren’t checked by the Norm, 
and must be checked during evaluation by the student.

• The $(NAME), clean, fclean, re and all rules are mandatory.

• If the makefile relinks, the project will be considered non-functional.

• In the case of a multibinary project, in addition to the above rules, 
you must have a rule that compiles both binaries 
as well as a specific rule for each binary compiled.

• In the case of a project that calls a function from a non-system library (e.g.: libft),
your makefile must compile this library automatically.

• All source files you need to compile your project 
must be explicitly named in your Makefile.
