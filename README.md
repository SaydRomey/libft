# libft

Welcome to `libft`, the first project in the 42 Common Core curriculum!  
This project introduces the basics of C programming and library development by implementing a standard C library.  
It is designed to strengthen your understanding of algorithms, memory management, and function implementation.

## Project Description

The goal of `libft` is to reimplement functions from the standard C library, as well as some additional utility functions,  
to create a custom library that will be reused in future projects.  
Below, youâ€™ll find a categorized list of all the functions included in this repository.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/libft.git
   cd libft

2. Compile the library:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Include libft.h in your C projects and link the compiled library:
   ```c
   #include "libft.h"
   gcc -L. -lft your_program.c -o your_program
   ```

---

# Makefile Instructions

```bash
make <target>
```

## Required Targets
- `all`: Compiles all source files into object files and creates the `libft.a` library.
- `clean`: Removes all compiled object files (.o) in the obj directory.
- `fclean`: Removes all compiled object files and the libft.a library.
- `re`: Runs the fclean target and then the all target to recompile everything from scratch.

## Additional Targets
- `norm`: Runs [norminette](https://github.com/42School/norminette) on all .h and .c files to check for coding style compliance.
- `nm`: Displays all the functions in the compiled libft.a library. Filters out any symbols not starting with ft_ and removes duplicates.
- `title`: Prints a custom ASCII art title in the terminal.

# Installing `libft` as a System Library

To make `libft` usable with `#include <libft.h> in yout projects, follow these steps:

## 1. Build the Library
Run the following command to build the libft.a static library:
```bash
make
```

## 2. Copy the Library to a System Location
Move the `libft.a` file to a standard system library path, such as `/usr/local/lib`:
```bash
sudo cp libft.a /usr/local/lib
```

## 3. Copy the Header File
Move the `libft.h` file to a standard include path, such as `/usr/local/include`:
```bash
sudo cp inc/libft.h /usr/local/include
```
## 4. Update the System's Library Cache (if needed)
Run `ldconfig` to update the linker cache:
```bash
sudo ldconfig
```
## 5. Using libft in Your Code
Now you can use #include <libft.h> in your C files.  
To compile a program that uses libft, link it with the library like this:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -L/usr/local/lib -lft your_program.c -o your_program
```
## 6. Verify the Setup
To check that the library is installed correctly, use:
```bash
nm /usr/local/lib/libft.a
```
This should list all the functions defined in your library.
